## END TO END MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION PROJECT

This project is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer is satisfied or not with their
banking experience. In this project, we have used the Santander Bank customer dataset, which is based on various
customer satisfaction surveys. The surveys will be preprocessed and converted into a format that can be used by the
model. During preprocessing, we removed constants, quasi-constants, and duplicate features. We have used a
convolutional neural network (CNN) layer for model building and prediction. We also used various libraries such as
Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib.
